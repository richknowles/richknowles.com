#### ***Present Day***

*Hello. My name is Rich. I live in Elgin, IL providing seasoned technical services wherever I’m needed.*



#### ***Cutting my I.Teeth***

I worked as an IT apprentice before joining the Marines to Earn The Title and then a certified Electrical Engineer in Aircraft Avionics.

I have 25+ years of paid, professional experience starting as a technician with DEC, HP, Kraft Foods. 

My career rapidly accelerated at Motorola for 10 years in Schaumburg. After zeroing out all Mac support tickets (Motorola made the Mac CPU’s) I worked to become a Senior Level 4 Engineer. I managed various development teams in Radio Engineering IT and cybersecurity.  I established the first-ever Desktop Architecture team and worked with both Dell and HP to deliver us the first-ever, now “Industry Standard” Certified Factory Image. Globally every engineering workstation and laptop was tested, standardized and approved by my work as Chairman of the Global Engineering Standards Committee.
